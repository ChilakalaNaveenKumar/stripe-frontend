## AI-Powered E-Commerce Platform - Project Concept

### **Project Overview**
The AI-powered e-commerce platform is designed to offer personalized shopping experiences using artificial intelligence. It will include AI-driven recommendations, dynamic pricing, and an advanced search system to enhance user engagement and conversion rates.

### **Core Features**
1. **User Authentication & Management**
   - JWT-based authentication with Spring Security
   - Role-based access control (Admin, Seller, Customer)
   - OAuth integration for Google and Facebook login

2. **AI-Powered Product Recommendations**
   - Machine learning-based recommendations using TensorFlow/PyTorch
   - User behavior tracking for personalized suggestions
   - Integration with Elasticsearch for fast and relevant product searches

3. **Dynamic Pricing System**
   - AI-driven pricing adjustment based on demand and competition
   - Custom discount generation for returning customers
   
4. **Product Catalog & Inventory Management**
   - CRUD operations for products with multiple categories and variations
   - Stock management with automated low-stock alerts
   - Multi-image and video uploads for product descriptions

5. **Payment & Checkout Integration**
   - Stripe and PayPal integration for seamless transactions
   - Apple Pay and Google Pay support
   - Multi-currency and tax calculations

6. **Order Processing & Tracking**
   - Order confirmation, shipment tracking, and automated invoicing
   - Integration with third-party shipping APIs (FedEx, UPS, USPS)
   
7. **Admin Dashboard & Analytics**
   - Sales reports and customer behavior insights
   - Inventory and revenue tracking
   - User analytics with heatmaps and conversion tracking

### **Technology Stack**
#### **Backend** (Spring Boot - Java)
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- Spring Data JPA (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Redis (Caching)
- REST API with Swagger Documentation

#### **Frontend** (Vue.js/Nuxt.js)
- Vue.js/Nuxt.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Vuex (State Management)
- Axios (API calls)

#### **Infrastructure & DevOps**
- Docker & Kubernetes (Containerization & Orchestration)
- AWS (S3, Lambda, EC2)
- CI/CD with Jenkins & GitHub Actions
- Elasticsearch (Search Optimization)

### **Next Steps**
1. **Setup Backend Project Structure** (Spring Boot)
2. **Setup Frontend Project Structure** (Vue.js/Nuxt.js)
3. **Database Schema Design**
4. **API Development & Integration**
5. **Build AI Model for Recommendations**

This will serve as the foundation for the project.



# Project README

## Overview
This project is designed to run a multi-container application using **Docker Compose**. The application consists of the following services:

1. **Backend**: Runs the server-side logic.
2. **Frontend**: Serves the user interface.
3. **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores application data.
4. **Redis**: Used for caching.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (bundled with Docker Desktop)

To verify your installation, run:
```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

## Steps to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this project repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Build and Start the Application
Use Docker Compose to build and start all services:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This command:
- Builds Docker images for the backend and frontend.
- Starts all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### 3. Access the Application
- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend**: [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)

### 4. Environment Variables
The following environment variables are used in the project. Make sure to update them as necessary:

- **Backend**:
  - `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`
  - Database configuration (in `docker-compose.yml`):
    - `POSTGRES_USER`
    - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
    - `POSTGRES_DB`

- **Frontend**: No special environment variables required for this setup.

- **Database (PostgreSQL)**:
  - `POSTGRES_USER`
  - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
  - `POSTGRES_DB`

These variables are preconfigured in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### 5. Stop the Application
To stop the running containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
This stops and removes all containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### 6. Cleanup (Optional)
To remove all Docker containers, networks, and images:
```bash
docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes
```

└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Port Conflicts**:
   - If ports `3000` or `8090` are already in use, update the `docker-compose.yml` file to use different ports.

2. **Access Denied to Database**:
   - Ensure the `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` values in the `docker-compose.yml` file match the database initialization values.

3. **Logs**:
   - To view service logs, use:
     ```bash
     docker-compose logs <service-name>
     ```

4. **Rebuild Images**:
   - If you make changes to the code, rebuild the images with:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

## Next Steps
For future deployment, Kubernetes can be used to manage the services in a production environment. Documentation for Kubernetes deployment will be provided later.
