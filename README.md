   - OAuth integration for Google and Facebook login

2. **AI-Powered Product Recommendations**
   - Machine learning-based recommendations using TensorFlow/PyTorch
   - User behavior tracking for personalized suggestions
   - Integration with Elasticsearch for fast and relevant product searches

3. **Dynamic Pricing System**
   - AI-driven pricing adjustment based on demand and competition
   - Custom discount generation for returning customers
   
4. **Product Catalog & Inventory Management**
